It might seem a bit outdated to recommend Obsidian in 2025. In fact, I first downloaded this tool in early 2023, but at that time, I found it confusing. I tried following online tutorials with titles like *"Build Your Own Wiki"*, but I couldn't stick with it consistently.  

However, now that I’ve started working on my thesis—while simultaneously learning new technical knowledge and managing multiple projects—I’ve picked up Obsidian again. And this time, I’ve fallen in love with it.  

As a research student working across multiple domains, I often find myself juggling diverse knowledge sources when exploring new areas, from crash courses and academic papers to forum discussions and AI-powered explanations. To effectively navigate this complexity, I leverage **Obsidian** as my central knowledge management tool. Here’s how I structure my workflow to facilitate both **non-linear exploration** and **structured documentation**.  

## **1. Excalidraw – Organizing Non-Linear Study Paths**  
For topics that require rapid comprehension, I use **Excalidraw** (a super handy whiteboard plug-in) within Obsidian to construct **a flexible, non-linear learning space**. This approach allows me to:  
- Collect and organize diverse learning materials, such as:  
  - Concise **crash courses**  
  - **GPT-generated explanations** and screenshots  
  - **Forum discussions** and expert insights  
  - Any supplementary resources that help me grasp a concept quickly  

**Pros**: The whiteboard-based structure offers a **highly flexible** way to map out relationships between concepts.  
**Cons**: No AI integration possibilities, but at this stage, it’s not a critical limitation.

## **2. Markdown – Structured Documentation and Project Tracking**  

For more linear and structured processes, I rely on **Markdown-based notes** within Obsidian. This is particularly useful for:  

- **Tracking the implementation process** of structured tutorials  
- Maintaining **project logs** to answer key questions:  
	- What needs to be done? When should it be tackled?  
	- What insights have emerged?  
	- What references or readings support deeper understanding?  
- More writing works like annotated bibliography
	- Highlighted text block in Zotero pdf can be dragged here, and the embedded link points back to the certain page in Zotero pdf. Sweet!

**Pros**: Markdown’s compatibility with AI tools allows me to:  
  - **Format notes efficiently**  
  - **Organize content dynamically**, such as asking AI to structure insights into markdown tables or csv files


## **3. Knowledge Management Framework: PJ, CS, and KN**  

To establish meaningful connections between different types of work, I structure my Obsidian vault using three primary folder prefixes:  

- **PJ_ (Projects)** – Ongoing project work which might relates to Courses
- **CS_ (Courses)** – Course-related materials  
- **KN_ (Knowledge)** – General knowledge and concepts that support both PJ and CS

### Cross-Linking for a Networked Knowledge System

- **KN (Knowledge) feeds into PJ (Projects)**, providing foundational insights.  
- **PJ (Projects) may feed into specific CS (Courses)**, ensuring academic alignment.  
- **Obsidian’s internal linking** allows me to establish these connections, making my knowledge graph more dynamic and interconnected—each element reinforcing the others.  

By structuring my workflow in this way, I’m able to **seamlessly switch between exploratory learning and structured research**, making the most of both non-linear and linear study approaches.

The only thing I really hate? Sometimes, I find myself losing an entire afternoon just **browsing the Obsidian plugin library**—it’s a rabbit hole! Since Obsidian is open-source, many hackers and developers treat it as a playground for innovation. Hopefully, one day, I can publish my own plugin.
