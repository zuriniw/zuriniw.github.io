Recently, I've been working on a project called [ML Co-Curation↗](https://zuriniw.github.io/projects/autopfl/autopfl.html). I came across a highly inspiring precedent and quickly prototyped my idea. Before moving to the next step, I paused to reflect and articulate my thoughts, helping me gain a clearer understanding of the project.. Interestingly, I realized I had unintentionally followed the **_Pre-thesis Framework_: starting with an intriguing idea → forming key research questions → gathering reading materials → outlining a general plan.** I didn’t set out to follow this structure, but I found it incredibly helpful. It’s not a rigid, linear process but rather a flexible framework that provides direction, sparks new ideas along the way, and maintains a balance between critical thinking and hands-on experimentation.

I’m still figuring out my thesis work. Honestly, this process feels more intuitive than the challenges of thesis research because this project is on a smaller scale—making it easier to organize everything. However, I do see 2 key takeaways that could inform my thesis:

1. **Unpacking concepts within research questions can help build a framework.**  

	In my research questions, I highlighted _creativity_ and _quality_ of work. Clarifying these terms is crucial, as their definitions directly shape the project's direction and, in some cases, may even shift its focus entirely.
	
	During prototype testing, I realized that the quality of machine learning output cannot be quantified in the way it typically is in ML applications. When experimenting with my own work, I found that while the layout and sequencing weren’t always perfect, they sometimes revealed unexpected connections between pieces—connections that felt meaningful and even playful. This led me to rethink the evaluation criteria, particularly what defines creativity and quality in this context.
	
	At this point, I also drew on Margaret Boden’s theory of **combinatorial, exploratory, and transformational creativity** (Boden, 2004) to better understand how machine learning could contribute to creative work beyond optimization and pattern recognition.

2. **Recursing after a rough start**

	This micro-project taught me to embrace **‘controlled chaos’**—starting roughly, refining iteratively. This approach aligns loosely with **Klein’s ‘Recognition-Primed Decision Model’** (Klein, 1998), where intuition drives rapid action, and analysis refines it over time.
	
	The process is inherently recursive—alternating between thinking and doing leads to unexpected turns. Without regular reflection, it's easy to lose track of the core goal. I’ve found it essential to continuously ask: _What is the goal? Which part of this step answers the initial question? Which part sparks new questions worth exploring?_
	Additionally, determining the **recursion termination condition** is just as critical—knowing when to stop iterating and move forward ensures the project remains productive rather than endlessly cyclical.

If scaling this approach to a full thesis, I anticipate a challenge in documenting recursive iterations. One solution might be a ‘process traceability matrix’ linking each experiment to specific point(s) in research questions.
