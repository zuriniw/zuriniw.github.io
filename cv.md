## Experience  

<dl>
    <dt>Research Student at Interactive Structures Lab, Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University</dt>
    <dd>2025.04 - Present</dd>
</dl>

- Designed and conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study on how users perceive a proactive portable personal robot performing different types of assistances across private, social, and public contexts; synthesized quantitative and qualitative findings into design recommendations for developing unobtrusive proactive physical assistance
- Developing a real-time computational pipeline for proactive physical agents to perceive and reason about contextual cues, and to orchestrate multimodal proactive behaviors to initiate assistance &nbsp;(ongoing)
