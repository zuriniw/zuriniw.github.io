## Experience  

<dl>
    <dt>Research Student at Interactive Structures Lab, Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University</dt>
    <dd>2025.04 - Present</dd>
</dl>

- Conducted a Wizard-of-Oz user study on small-scale personal robots across private, social, and public-work environments; modeled intention-aware and intention-revealing proactivity, and distilled quantitative and qualitative findings into design recommendations for unobtrusive proactive robots.  
- Building a computational pipeline to orchestrate the multimodal behaviors of proactive personal robots, integrating perception, decision-making, and interaction modules (ongoing).

<br>
<dl>
    <dt>Research Student at CodeLab, Carnegie Mellon University</dt>
    <dd>2025.02 - 2025.06</dd>
</dl>

- Independent Project 1: Implemented a real-time system that transformed hand shadows into six-panel comic storytelling, leveraging MediaPipe for motion capture, StreamDiffusion for real-time image synthesis, and an LLM for caption generation.  
- Independent Project 2: Experimented with ML techniques to automate the curation of creative works, exploring varying balances between human-led and machine-led decision-making.

<br>
<dl>
    <dt>Research Intern at WHY Research Lab, Carnegie Mellon University</dt>
    <dd>2024.08 - 2025.01</dd>
</dl>

- Built the WasteStation database in Notion to map connections between components and potential reuse applications  
- Replicated the 'Ladybug' project, which transformed dismantled disk drives into a scanning device through disassembly, resoldering, and Raspberry Pi integration

<br>
<dl>
    <dt>Research Assistant, Humachine Lab, Soochow University</dt>
    <dd>2021.08 - 2022.07</dd>
</dl>

- Executed Mixed Reality (MR) workflows in nonlinear panel assembly of a full-scale house within 10 days  
- Framed and led four on-site collaboration methods to maximize the benefits of MR in registration, adjustment, synchronized work, and cross-time work  
- Documented the design-to-construction process and contributed to academic writing
