## Experience  

<dl>
    <dt>Research Student | Interactive Structures Lab, Human-Computer Interaction Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University</dt>
    <dd>Mar 2025 - Present</dd>
</dl>
Advisor: Prof. Alexandra Ion
- Developing a computational system for task-aware interruptibility estimation; leveraging multimodal LLMs to infer urgency, importance, and semantic relevance of robot goals relative to user activity; optimize robot interruption timing, trajectory, and notification details in high-stakes environments (See R1) 
- Led a Wizard-of-Oz study (N=15) examining user perception of proactive robots; designed a 2×3 experiment (proactivity type × level) across 3 environments; mixed-methods analysis revealed environment and proactivity type shape perceived helpfulness and distraction; articulated design implications around privacy, agency, and trust (See R2) 
- Contributed to a human-robot interaction study investigating the interplay between robotic arm mounting formats and assistance initiative levels (See R3)
