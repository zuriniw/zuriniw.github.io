## Experience  

<dl>
    <dt>Research Student, Interactive Structures Lab, Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University</dt>
    <dd>Mar 2025 - Present</dd>
</dl>

- Designed and conducted empirical human-robot interaction studies, investigating how users perceive proactive robot assistance across contexts, tasks, and proactivity; synthesized quantitative and qualitative results into design recommendations for unobtrusive assistance by physical agents
- Developing an optimizer that selects, orchestrates, and schedules distributed multimodal outputs to initiate contextually appropriate assistance &nbsp;(ongoing)
