## Experience

**Research Student, Interactive Structures Lab, Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University** \hfill Mar 2025 - Present

- Designed and conducted empirical human-robot interaction studies, investigating how users perceive proactive robot assistance across contexts, tasks, and proactivity; synthesized quantitative and qualitative results into design recommendations for unobtrusive assistance by physical agents.
- Developing an optimizer that selects, orchestrates, and schedules distributed multimodal outputs to initiate contextually appropriate assistance &nbsp;(ongoing)



**Research Intern, WHY Research Lab, Carnegie Mellon University** \hfill Aug 2024 - Jan 2025

- Replicated the “Ladybug” project by disassembling and re-soldering disk drives and integrating a Raspberry Pi.
- Built the WasteStation database in Notion to map connections between components and potential reuse applications



**Research Assistant, Humachine Lab, Soochow University** \hfill Aug 2021 - Jul 2022

- Implemented MR workflows for nonlinear façade assembly and designed four on-site collaboration methods to maximize utilization of limited MR devices within a small, low-tech construction team.
- Documented the design-to-construction process and contributed to academic writing
