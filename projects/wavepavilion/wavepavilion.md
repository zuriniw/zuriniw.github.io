## Form Finding

Step 1: Form Computation

First, the edge control curve and the top curve are positioned on a plane. Then, the edge control curve is stretched along the z-axis to form a spatial curve. Four support points on the spatial curve are selected as anchors, and these anchors, together with the two curves, are used for form computation.

Step 2: Structural Density Optimization

A force flow analysis is conducted on the form surface obtained from Step 1. Based on the resulting density distribution, ribs are added to the inner side of the surface to meet structural requirements with minimal weight.
