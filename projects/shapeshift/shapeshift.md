## Tech log
**Pre-TP0 Accomplishments**  
  - Initial progress on TP ideation and design proposal submission.

<br>

**TP0 (11/18) Accomplishments**  
  - **Core Features**  
    - Component Management:  
      - Create components via toolbar/keyboard shortcuts.  
      - Drag-and-drop, delete, multi-select, and group movement.  
    - Data Flow System:  
      - One-way data flow with default input values, type checking, and automatic propagation.  
    - Component Types:  
      - Geometric (CircleCreator, RectCreator, Point).  
      - Mathematical (UnaryOperator, BinaryOperator, Slider).  
      - Vector (Vector, VectorPreview).  
      - Manipulation (Move).  
    - UI Features:  
      - Toggle displays (axis, grid, dots, guidebook).  
      - Toolbar with category tabs, component previews, and visual feedback.  
    - Technical Notes:  
      - Module dependencies need reorganization. 

<br>


**TP1 (11/25) Notes & Goals**  
  - **Feedback from TP0**:  
    - Improve component complexity (e.g., vector analysis, sliders for shape control).  
    - Fix bugs and redesign workspace layout (design area at canvas bottom).  
  - **Goals for TP2**:  
    - Implement error system.  
    - Expand component library.  
    - Add file load/management.  
    - Optional: Richer data structures in data flow. 

<br>


**TP2 (12/2) Accomplishments**  
  - **New Features**:  
    - Components:  
      - Series, 2D Slider, Panel, Distance.  
      - Enhanced sliders with pinning, nicknames, and precision control.  
      - Toggle visibility for intermediate geometries.  
    - Technical Redesign:  
      - Data representation shifted to 2D lists (supporting multiple geometries/values).  
  - **Challenges**:  
    - Debugging pinned sliders and managing 2D list communication between components.  
  - **Goals for TP3**:  
    - Error system implementation.  
    - Optional: 2D slider recording/playback for animations.  
    - Code cleanup and organization.  

<br>

**TP3 (12/6) Final Features**  
  - **General Features**:  
    - World coordinate system for intuitive drawing.  
    - Drag-and-drop component creation.  
    - Right-side panel for grid/axis toggles and text hints.  
    - Node-based wiring with error detection (red connections + hints).  
    - One-way data flow with default values and multi-geometry support.  
    - Floating component information boxes on hover.  
  - **Key Components**:  
    - Sliders (1D/2D):  
      - Customizable boundaries, nicknames, precision, and pinning.  
      - 2D slider recording/playback for animations.  
    - Panel: Displays real-time output data for transparency.  
  - **Component Class Hierarchy**:  
    - Base `Component` class with subclasses:  
      - `TypicleComponent` (Point, Vector, Operators, Series).  
      - `Slider` hierarchy (1D/2D Base/Pinned variants).  
      - `Panel` for data visualization.
