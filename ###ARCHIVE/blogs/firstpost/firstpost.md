## A ”Dump in Matrix“
I want research on myself to be the first part , aiming to learn myself as a interdisciplinary student with a design background. When creating a résumé or portfolio, designers and art practitioners typically showcase selected works. However, as a growing design/art researcher, in this process of studying myself, I have not skipped too many projects here because my goal is to honestly examine my trajectory.

I have built a digital archive and created a two-axis Dump in Matrix. The horizontal axis ranges from Narrative to Instrumental, while the vertical axis ranges from Experimental to Practical—these axes serve to interpret the internal goals of my projects. Labels such as Digital, Physical/Spatial, XR, and Embodied describe the external forms or media. Each work is scored across these two dimensions, tagged accordingly, and includes metadata such as time, collaboration status, tools used, and other attributes. From a temporal perspective, I find myself increasingly inclined toward creating adaptive interfaces (a fuzzy spectrum from narrative to tools) for people to resonate with information, knowledge and memories.

## Navigate to both ends of the spectrum
### Adaptive Narrative

_create embodied generative taskscape for reimagine/reinterpret memory and culture._

Here are 2 of my ongoing projects that may articulate this: Hand Shadow Game(2025) serve as an entry point for reinterpreting childhood memories through the machine's lens. By capturing human gestures and generating interactive imagery in real-time using generative AI, the project explores how machines reshape personal and cultural recollections. 5-Animal Play(2025) scales up the hand shadow game, introducing deeper entanglements between two-dimensional projections and three-dimensional bodily movements, as well as between human actions and their sensory experiences. In the physical world, hand shadows and bodily postures function as analog signs—simulated symbols of childhood and cultural heritage. As the machine translates these gestures (analog sign) into vectors (digital signs), moments of misreading and reinterpretation emerge. This tension reflects an ongoing negotiation between embodied human memory and machine memory, each vying for the authority to narrate and reshape the past.

### Adaptive Tools

_leverage technology to refine the existing system_

While systems were originally invented by humans, they were not inherently "good" upon creation, as they come with inherent but reasonable limitations and constraints. The development of a technology may take five years, but its true optimization—ensuring that it integrates seamlessly and meaningfully into human contexts—often requires recurring cycles of refinement, each spanning multiple five-year iterations. These cycles of adjustment resonate with ongoing technological advancements, creating a dynamic interplay between innovation and adaptation. In digital systems, adaptive interfaces shift the paradigm from humans learning system operations to systems adapting to human behaviors within everyday contexts. In physical systems, adaptation operates on multiple scales: at a smaller scale, new materials can be modularized into physical agents or tangible interfaces; at a larger scale, responsive environments can be seen both as tools that serve human needs and as immersive narrative containers that shape experiences. Traditionally, adaptation has been achieved through mathematical modeling and algorithmic optimization, seeking optimal solutions to predefined problems. However, modern machine learning (ML) introduces situated intelligence for context-based problems, opening new directions for adaptation. Yet, applying these technologies raises significant feasibility and ethical concerns, making it crucial to explore how they can be responsibly and effectively integrated into human systems.
### Summary
Whether in narrative or tools, adaptation through technology creates new paradigms within existing systems, incorporating both human factors and environmental factors. This dynamic interplay between constraint and possibility makes it a evolving field. The challenge lies in ensuring technologies integrate meaningfully and ethically into human and environmental contexts. True adaptation is an ongoing process, requiring continuous learning and refinement. There’s no fixed endpoint—only deeper layers to explore, experiment with, and understand. I think I have a long way to go and a lot of things to learn.
